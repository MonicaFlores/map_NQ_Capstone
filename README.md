## NQ Capstone Map

This map shows the location of publicly owned vacant lots and community gardens in the South Bronx Community Districts 1, 2 and 3. 
The information was gathered in the Nos Quedamos - NYU Wagner Capstone Project, 2017-2018.

### The Project
We Stay/Nos Quedamos (NQ) is a non-profit organization located in the South Bronx. 
NQ is pursuing the establishment of a Community Land Trust (CLT): 
a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation that will own and steward land for the public good. 
The South Bronx Community Land Trust (SBxCLT) aims to address a lack of affordable housing in the South Bronx, 
and create a more equitable community in the area.

### The NYU Capstone Team
This NYU Capstone team was tasked to aid in the establishment of the SBxCLT through an implementation plan. 
Our work included: Existing Conditions and Data Analysis; Case Study and Technical Aspects Research; 
a SWOT analysis of the current situation; and a set of recommendations for successfully establishing a CLT in the South Bronx. 
The content of this map reflects the data collection work of our Capstone team.
